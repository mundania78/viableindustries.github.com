# Content Outline

A collection of the ideas, imagery, and other content that should appear on the initial website. We will begin to unfold the types of content we wish to cover by answering the questions below.

- Why. Why we do what we do. Why we exist and why anyone would care.
- How. How we do what we do. How we start, manage, and execute great projects.
- What. What it is we do. What are the specific things that we do.


# Moving forward

As we move forward and grow as a company, what are some markets or market places that we could tap. For example, prebuilt themes for WordPress, Shopify, or Drupal.

## Ideas for mass distribution.

### Overview

My intentions for this are not "do them all and make more money" it would be pick a couple and be really awesome at them.

1. Provide support with all purchases. No purchase is complete without some type of support included. Whether that be access to some type of well illustrated and thorough documentation with concepts and examples, or if it's video tutorials. If the user so decides they could optionally pay for email support, setup services, or extended hands-on support.
2. Provide high quality products. High quality in the sense that from the design, to the validating front-end code, to the cross-browser/platform responsive capabilities we don't let things slip through the cracks.

### An outline of possible markets

- Shopify. I hold these guys in high regard, I've used them several times for projects, and they have an extremely solid product. They make ecommerce extremely simple for designers and developers, while retaining ease of use for the actual customer. In addition to the basic ecommerce elements, they offer a module platform that we can sell to, a theme platform we can sell to, and any stores that we setup under them .. we receive at 15% kick back off of all sales. We could sell themes/modules directly through their online marketplace.
- WordPress. I'm not sure what the best way to distribute these would be. I've often considered a custom store approach .. one not tied to something like WooThemes or ThemeForest, but rather a standalone site that would enable us to cut out the middle man and maybe even push a "setup service" or similar.
- SquareSpace. This is a hosted CMS
- Tumblr. This one is further down on the list for a reason, but I still think that there is a good market for these, especially if they're well designed.
